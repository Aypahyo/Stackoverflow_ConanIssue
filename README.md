# Stackoverflow_ConanIssue
This is for a stackoverflow question
Specifically for [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64268450/dockerized-conan-shows-fileexistserror-errno-17-file-exists-util-linux-2)

The general idea is that this image could resolve dependencies for a project of mine.
I modify that project a lot on different machines and run into simmilar issues all the time.
The hope is to one day be able to transport my build environment and modifications to it between machines.
